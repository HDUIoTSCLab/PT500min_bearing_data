This bearing dataset is publicly available from the Laboratory of Smart Sensing and Control at Hangzhou Dianzi University. 

This dataset was obtained from a bearing fault experimental platform. It includes vibration acceleration data for ten types of bearing faults: Normal (N), Inner Race Fault (IF), Outer Race Fault (OF), Ball Fault (BF), Cage Fault (CF), Inner and Outer Race Compound Fault (IF&OF), Inner Race and Ball Compound Fault (IF&BF), Inner Race and Cage Compound Fault (IF&CF), Outer Race and Ball Compound Fault (OF&BF), and Inner and Outer Race and Ball Compound Fault (IF&OF&BF).

Each type of bearing fault data contains two folders: 1.rpm1000_var_load: Contains data for seven different load forces at a fixed speed of 1000 rpm. The load forces are 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 N. 2.var_speed_f600: Contains data for seven different speeds at a fixed load force of 600 N. The speeds are 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 rpm.

For dataset, each folder for a specific operating condition contains 10 .mat files, representing ten data collections. The data sampling frequency of this experimental platform is 10 kHz, and the sampling time ranges from 20 to 25 seconds. Four vibration sensors are used for data collection. Therefore, the data dimensions in each .mat file are (4, 200000+), where the first dimension corresponds to the four different vibration measurement positions mentioned above, each with over 200000 data points.

Due to the large size of the entire dataset, it is not convenient to download directly. The table below shows each type of fault and its corresponding download link:
